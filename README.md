**Skin Disease Classification Project README**

Welcome to the Skin Disease Classification project! This repository contains code and resources for building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify different types of skin diseases from images.

### Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify various skin diseases based on images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, we aim to create a robust solution that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing skin conditions more efficiently.

### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of images depicting various types of skin diseases. It is crucial to ensure the dataset is diverse and representative of different skin conditions to train a model effectively. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

### Model Architecture:
We employ a CNN architecture for this classification task. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from images. The architecture may consist of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, fully connected layers, and eventually a softmax layer for classification.

### Requirements:
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
